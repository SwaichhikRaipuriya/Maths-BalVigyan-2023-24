‘Coding’ or ‘Computer Programming’ involves creating step-by-step instructions that have a logical structure. <br>
Inputting these instructions means a computer can execute a program, or a compiled set of programs, called software applications<br>
<br>
When you write a computer program using a high-level language like Python, you are instructing a computer what to do for a specific purpose.
 This instruction is then translated into machine codes and binary bits of information by the computer. Although you can use ready-made and
 user-friendly applications to do certain tasks, there are many cases where you’ll need to customize your programs or software applications,
 or even develop your own.<br>
<br>
Computer coding can be classified into four major types:<br>
•	Imperative or Procedural (examples: COBOL, FORTRAN, C, etc.)<br>
•	Functional (examples: Haskell, Scala, Clojure, etc.)<br>
•	Logical (examples: Prolog, SQL, etc.)<br>
•	Object-oriented (examples: Java, C++, Python, etc.)<br>
<br>
Many high-level programming languages use logic and functions <br>
to define instructions.<br>

<h1 align="center"> Coding:  A Gateway to Limitless Opportunities </h1>
</div>
<p>
In the 21st century, coding has emerged as a vital skill that extends far
 beyond the confines of computer screens. The benefits of coding reach into
various aspects of our lives, offering a multitude of advantages that contribute 
to personal growth, professional success, and societal progress.
<br>
<br>
1.Enhanced Problem-Solving Skills: Coding is, at its core, a problem-solving endeavour.
  Engaging in coding activities sharpens analytical thinking, encouraging individuals to break
  down complex challenges into manageable components. This honing of problem-solving skills is a 
  valuable asset applicable in every facet of life.
<br>
<br>
2.Empowerment through Creativity: Coding is a creative process that empowers individuals
  to bring their ideas to life in the digital realm. Whether designing a website, crafting a mobile app,
  or developing a game, programming provides a platform for self-expression and innovation, fostering a 
  sense of creative empowerment.
<br>
<br>
3.Global Connectivity and Collaboration: The ability to design programming codes transcends
  geographical boundaries. In our interconnected world, coding serves as a universal language that 
  facilitates collaboration and communication across borders. Programmers can contribute to global
  projects, participate in open-source communities, and collaborate with like-minded individuals 
  from diverse backgrounds.

<h1 align="center"> Mathematics behind coding </h1>
</div>
<p>
You don't need to be a mathematics expert to become a programmer, but mathematics greatly enhances your skills.
Programming is often thought to be a subject that doesn’t require much mathematical knowledge. Even though you 
don’t need to be a mathematics expert to become a programmer, some mathematical concepts are necessary to enhance
 your programming and problem-solving skills.<br>
In the intricate tapestry of coding lies a concealed realm that silently orchestrates the elegance and efficiency
 of our digital world—hidden mathematics. As we interact with software, engage in algorithmic problem-solving, or 
witness the seamless execution of complex tasks, it's easy to overlook the mathematical foundation upon which these 
digital wonders are built.

<h1 align="center"> Mathematical operations in QR Codes </h1>
</div>

<p>
<h2 align="center"> Introduction </h2>
Since their 1994 invention by the DENSOCorporation in Japan, QR codes have provided a widely used method for quickly 
accessing information. Originally, QR codes were used for parts manufacturing inventory tracking, but they can now be
 found on advertisements, web pages, business cards, any many other mediums. QR codes are notable for their long-term stability
 and higher capacity for storage than other bar codes. However, like other physical means of storing data, QR codes are prone to 
errors. Reed-Solomon codes provide a mechanism for ensuring that QR code scanners can reliably process information when errors occur. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
<h2 align="center"> Data Representation and Finite Fields </h2>
QR codes encode text represented as binary numbers. The QR code standard allows for text strings to be created using four encoding modes:
 numeric, alphanumeric, byte, and kanji. In this paper we will describe the byte mode. Descriptions of the other three modes can be found
 in [5]. The byte mode of encoding text for QR codes utilizes the ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) character set.
 A list of the ASCII character set and the correspondences between characters and decimal numbers in ASCII for the printable characters on 
a modern keyboard is shown in Table
